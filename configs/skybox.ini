{
	//Path always has to be relative to materials/skybox and should not include the suffix and .vtf or .vmt
	//Example: You have the following files
	//materials/skybox/amethystbk.vmt
	//materials/skybox/amethystbk.vtf
	//materials/skybox/amethystdn.vmt
	//materials/skybox/amethystdn.vtf
	//materials/skybox/amethystft.vmt
	//etc...
	//You would set path to be "amethyst"
	//Name is the name that appears in the menu
	
	//The key name (or "1" in this case, does not matter) but try to make it unique
